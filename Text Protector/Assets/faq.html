<h1>How does Shield identify spam?</h1>
<p>Shield is a Machine Learning-based spam filter. We train it on what spam SMS usually looks like by showing it tens of thousands of spam SMSs beforehand. Shield then learns and, to a high degree of confidence, can identify spam even if it hadn't seen it before. </p>

<h1>Do you save or store any SMS data?</h1>
<p>SMS filters on iOS can't store any data to disk. They are sandboxed and locked down for maximum privacy by Apple. Shield runs locally, offline, and doesn't transfer any data over the network or even locally to the hosting app. This means Shield doesn't require nor use an internet connection to filter SMS spam.</p>

<h1>Can I block a group of similar phone numbers instead of manually adding each one to the Block List?</h1>
<p>Yes. Use the wild card symbol * to block a group of similar numbers. For example, if you add 00344* to the block list, all numbers starting with 00344 will be blocked.</p>

<h1>Can I block SMSes that contain a certain word?</h1>
<p>Yes. Open the "Block List" then tap on "Keywords" then <b>+</b> to add the word you would like to block.</p>


<h1>How can I delete an item from the Block List?</h1>
<p>Simply swipe to the left on the item you want to delete.</p>

<h1>I added a number to the Block List but I still got SMSs from that sender. Why?</h1>
<p>SMS filtering on iOS only works if the number is<b>not</b>in your contact list. If you want to block SMSs from someone on your contact list, make sure you first delete their number from your contacts. Then add their number to the block list in Shield. This is a restriction of iOS, not Shield.</p>

<h1>My question isn't answered above. How can I get in touch with you?</h1>
